"""The per-turn model-call budget (audit batch F09 / F13 / item 11).

Three related regressions, all about how many `llm.chat` calls ONE player turn is
allowed to spend:

- **F09** — the post-turn Scribe fired on every companion sub-turn: a companion's
  own turn re-enters `gateway.turn.run_turn` (`gateway.director.run_companion_turn`),
  and the Scribe block carried no `ctx.platform != "companion"` guard, unlike the
  companion-director call ten lines above it. One player turn with N companions
  spent 1+N Scribe calls and reconciled the same trackers 1+N times.
- **F13** — the chronicle fold's accounting compared the WHOLE assembled prompt's
  meter against the token size of the RECORDS it folded, two different things. What
  a fold actually frees is the replayed HISTORY its new watermark lets
  `agent.history.trim_folded` drop, so a room with nothing left to trim can not
  measurably shrink its prompt by folding — yet the meter stayed over the trigger and
  re-armed the fold on the very next turn, forever, for any room whose pressure comes
  from somewhere else (a big module).
- **item 11** — the resulting bound was written down nowhere. One turn is driven
  through a counting fake client and pinned against the ceiling AGENTS.md documents.

Everything here is offline: `FakeLLM` + `FakeEmbeddings`, no network, no keys.
