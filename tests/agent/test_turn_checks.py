"""ORACLE for M20 C: the two dice checks, and the Stop-form runner that acts on them.

The thing this replaces was 21 compiled regexes guessing whether a player's sentence had
attempted something checkable, plus two hand-written corrective phases. What is left is
only what can be decided without reading the fiction — and this file is where the honesty
about that lives:

- **contradiction is exact.** Dice ran; the prose states numbers; compare. There is a
  right answer and the test asserts it, CJK numerals included.
- **forgery is not exact, and the tolerance band is written down below** rather than
  quietly hoped away. Ordinary prose has numbers in it. The band is the price of asking a
  question with no intent-guessing in it, and it is far narrower than the lexicon it
  replaced — but a test suite that only listed the wins would be lying about the shape.
