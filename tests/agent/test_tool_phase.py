"""The play phase must not cost the Keeper its improvisation (M20 B).

The original cut would have moved `create_npc` into prep, which reads fine on paper and
breaks at the table: improvising a shopkeeper mid-scene is ordinary play, and
`speak_as_npc` returns not_found without a record — so a play-phase Keeper could neither
create the NPC nor voice it. Worse, no record means no knowledge-scoped actor, so that
NPC's private knowledge would have no structural home at all (iron rule #3). "Prep is one
command away" is not an answer: a keeper flipping phase to rescue one improvised line IS
the ceremony.

The acceptance test is therefore behavioural, not structural — a play-phase turn that
invents an NPC and gets a line out of it, with no phase switch anywhere.
