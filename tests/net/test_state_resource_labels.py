"""M19 item 8: `sheet.resources` labels resolve to the VIEWER's locale.

A pack's resource labels used to be one frozen string, so a bar authored in Chinese
read 潮位 to an English player and vice versa. Labels are now declared per locale and
resolved at the wire boundary — the same room, the same character, two connections,
two readings. The party roster additionally persists its meters at sync time, so its
stored label must NOT be what ships either.
