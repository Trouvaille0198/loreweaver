"""ORACLE: the end-of-turn check table cannot blow the per-turn model-call budget.

Same family as `tests/agent/test_turn_call_budget.py`, and it exists for a reason the
other one does not have: the table is **rulepack-declarable**. Content packs are data
written by other people, and one of them asking for `max_rounds: 40` must be a clamp, not
an outage. The engine clamps; this pins that it does.

The budget note in AGENTS.md includes the item-state correction alongside the existing
correctives: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6 chat calls per turn. The runner inherits that ceiling
exactly, so the table remains bounded as it grows.
