"""Iron rule #5, made structural: every model call site declares its LANE.

The rule's letter used to read "no other module may put text into the model's
context", while the code has — correctly — six independent callers: the Keeper turn,
four knowledge-SCOPED actors that must assemble their own prompt from their own record
(that scoping IS information isolation, iron rule #3), memory folding and authoring.
The invariant worth pinning is narrower and sharper:

* the KEEPER's context has exactly ONE assembler, `agent.prompt_builder`, and exactly
  ONE caller, the turn loop — no other module builds or extends what the Keeper sees;
* every other call site is a scoped actor, a memory fold or an authoring/prep lane,
  each with its own scoped assembler and NO access to the keeper pool beyond what its
  lane is entitled to;
* `core/` makes no model calls at all (iron rule #1 — the deterministic engine).

A new `.chat(...)` call site anywhere in production code fails this test until it is
added to `MODEL_CALL_LANES` with its lane named — which is the moment to ask whether it
should exist. A listed file that stops calling the model fails too, so the table never
rots. Plumbing wrappers (retry, provider mux) are listed so the scan stays exact.
