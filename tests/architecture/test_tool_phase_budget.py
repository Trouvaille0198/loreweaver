"""ORACLE: the play-phase toolset stays small (M20 B).

76 tools, 68 of them always on, 41k characters of generated schema re-sent every round of
every turn and every companion sub-turn. After M20 A most of that is a cache READ on the
primary path, so the motive is no longer headline token cost — it is model attention and
tool-selection quality, plus the uncached first call of every session.

A budget only holds if something counts it. This file is that something: it fails when a
new tool lands in the play phase without anyone deciding it belongs there. The fix when it
fails is usually `prep_only=True`, not a bigger number — raise the ceiling only with a
reason worth writing down.
