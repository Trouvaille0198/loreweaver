"""M23 WS1: room state nobody claims fails the build.

The four lifecycle operations (`.reset` at three scopes, delete, import, export) used to
carry hand-written lists of what to clean, and the lists drifted from the code that wrote
the state — three fixes in one month, plus a fourth this window. `infra/room_facets.py`
moved the answer to the state's OWNER; this file is what keeps the answer complete.

It scans the ACTUAL write surface rather than trusting a list:

- every `room_state` key a `state_set` call can write, resolved statically;
- every document type registered in `core.documents`;
- every vector `collection` constant in the engine.

Anything the registry does not claim is a failure. The escape hatch is deliberately
awkward: a named `(module, function)` entry below, with a written reason. It exists for
call sites that write a key some OTHER module owns (a restore, a caller-supplied key),
never for a family of state nobody has thought about.
