"""`.pack install <ref>` — landing a content pack on a RUNNING server, from the table.

Until this existed, installing a module meant shell access to the box: a keeper playing
over the wire could enable only what someone had already installed for them. The owner's
2026-08-19 verdict is that on a remote table install IS enable — the CLI's per-item
confirmation cannot be reproduced honestly across the wire, and a keeper who typed the ref
has already made the trust decision — so the reply carries the terminal's own disclosure
card plus one line saying plainly that the pack's code now runs in this room. Sharpened
2026-08-20: install means PLAYABLE, so it throws the pack's OTHER switches too — panels,
KP skills, and the world card when the pack ships exactly one. A per-item approval flow
is the thing this command exists to not have.

It shares ONE implementation with `python -m app --install` (`gateway.pack_install`), so
the two doors cannot drift over which directories a pack lands in or which caches are
cleared afterwards.
