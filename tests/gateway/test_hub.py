"""Tests for the RoomHub — the transport-agnostic session bus (M6 Phase 1).

These exercise the hub in isolation with in-memory ``FakeMember``s (no sockets):
subscribe/unsubscribe/online bookkeeping, fan-out to every member, ``exclude``,
the drop-a-raising-member guarantee, and — the crux of the cross-platform
vision — that two members on *different* transports in one room both receive a
published event.
