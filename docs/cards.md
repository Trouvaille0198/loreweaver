# Bring your SillyTavern cards

You have a folder of character cards and lorebooks. This page tells you what happens
when you drop them into Loreweaver: what imports, what actually runs, and where a
card behaves differently because it now lives inside a game with real dice. It is
written for card authors and card users; the full specification behind it
is [plugins.md](plugins.md).

The one-sentence summary: **cards and lorebooks import as-is — no conversion step —
and the variable / template / trigger machinery your card relies on runs**, inside
an engine that rolls real dice and validates every number.

One concept to hold onto first: Loreweaver **splits every card** (拆卡). An ST "heavy
card" fuses a character with a whole world — hook scripts, variable schemas,
executable templates — because single-player ST had nowhere else to put them. Here
those are two artifacts: the **character half** (persona, memory, abilities, a sheet)
that any player may import, and the **world half** (the machinery) that only the
room's Keeper imports, because it reprograms play for the whole table. Your card
isn't rejected either way — it's decomposed.

## What imports

- **Character cards** — SillyTavern **V2/V3** (`chara_card_v2` / `chara_card_v3`),
  as JSON or as a PNG with the embedded `chara` chunk. Fields consumed: `name`,
  `description`, `personality`, `scenario`, `first_mes`, `mes_example`,
  `system_prompt`, `post_history_instructions`, `alternate_greetings`, `tags`,
  `creator`, `character_version`, `character_book`, `extensions`. Unknown fields
  are ignored, never rejected — a card from a newer ST build still imports.
- **Lorebooks** — the card's embedded `character_book`, or a standalone lorebook
  JSON. Both the V2 `character_book` field names and ST-native world-info names map.
- **MVU variables** — `[InitVar]` / `[InitialVariables]` / `@@initial_variables`
  entries are consumed at **world import** into a per-room variable tree
  (JSON5-tolerant, nested CJK paths, `[value, "description"]` leaves). They are
  treated as data, not lore — they don't occupy prompt budget, and **re-importing a
  card never resets a room's variable progress**.
- **Hooks** — a card may carry `extensions.loreweaver_hooks`: sandboxed JavaScript
  on the turn lifecycle, installed at **world import**. That's Loreweaver's own
  extension point (the Tavern Helper idea, engine-validated); see [hooks.md](hooks.md).

## How to import

- **In the terminal client:** character creation offers four paths — roll, manual,
  AI draft, or **import a card**. Whichever path, the resulting sheet is validated
  against the rule system; a card whose numbers don't fit the rulepack gets fixed
  numbers, not a free pass.
- **By command:** `.import <card file> [coc7|dnd5e] [pc|companion|world]`.
  - `pc` (any player, via a room attachment) and `companion` (Keeper-only) take the
    **character half**. If the card also carries world machinery, the import strips
    it and tells you exactly what was stripped — the card still works as a
    character, and the message points the Keeper at the world half.
  - `world` (**Keeper-only**) imports the whole module in one step: the machinery
    half — full lorebook with Keeper trust, `[InitVar]` seeded, hooks installed —
    AND the character half, which lands on the room's **pre-generated roster** as a
    claimable, rule-validated PC. The card's PROSE (description, scenario, the
    authored opening and its alternates) is copied into a Keeper-only **module
    brief** the Keeper reads back with the `module_brief` tool — so the module's own
    opening can be quoted at the table instead of vanishing at import. Players pick their character with `.pc list` /
    `.pc claim <name>` (claims are exclusive; `.pc release` frees the slot and the
    next claimant starts from the pristine sheet). For an AI-played version of the
    same character, `.import <file> companion` still works.
  - Importing from a server-side path (rather than a room attachment) is Keeper-only
    in every mode. Standalone lorebooks: `.lore import <file>` (Keeper-only).
- **As part of a pack:** cards and lorebooks travel inside `.lwpack` content packs —
  `python -m app --install gh:owner/repo` — alongside skills, rulepacks and assets
  (see [plugins.md](plugins.md)).

## What actually runs

Imported cards don't just contribute prose — the machinery runs, with deterministic
code doing the bookkeeping. (Everything below describes the **world half**, live after
a Keeper's `.import <file> world`; a character import carries none of it.)

- **Worldbook trigger semantics.** Primary `keys`; `secondary_keys` with all four
  selective logics (AND ANY / AND ALL / NOT ANY / NOT ALL); `probability` — rolled
  by real code, not narrated; case-sensitive and whole-word matching; `scan_depth`
  windows; `position` ordering buckets; timed effects — `sticky`, `cooldown`,
  `delay` — against a per-room turn counter; inclusion groups (weighted, one member
  per group per turn); budgeted insertion.
- **The MVU protocol, end-to-end.** Your card's scaffolding entries import as normal
  lore, the model emits `<UpdateVariable>` blocks, and the engine parses them with
  real code — all five ops (`set` / `insert` / `delete` / `add` / `move`) — applies
  them to the variable tree, and strips the blocks from what players see. The
  schema-checked tool calls (`set_stat` / `adjust_stat` / `get_stat`) are the
  preferred channel onto the same tree.
- **Full EJS — real JavaScript.** With the `ejs` extra installed (on by default),
  worldbook and card content renders through the official EJS library + lodash in an
  embedded QuickJS sandbox: loops, functions, `await`, lodash chains, arbitrary-JS
  `@@if` conditions, `setvar`/`incvar` (buffered, applied by engine code after
  rendering), `getwi`/`activewi`, `injectPrompt`, `execvar`. Same trust model as
  SillyTavern itself: your box, your cards.
- **Macros.** `{{user}}` (the active PC, resolved at render time), `{{char}}`,
  `{{time}}` / `{{date}}`, `{{roll:XdY}}`, `{{random}}`, `{{pick}}`, `{{newline}}`,
  `{{// comments}}`, `{{getvar::}}` / `{{var:}}`. Note for authors:
  `{{random}}`/`{{pick}}` (and lore `probability` rolls) draw from real code
  randomness seeded per **(room, turn)** — different turns vary freely, but re-running
  the SAME turn (a retry, an undo replay) reproduces the same picks, so what the
  model saw is always reconstructable. The two draws use separate streams: adding a
  `{{random}}` macro never shifts which probabilistic lore entries fire.
- **The tracker panel is Keeper-curated.** Your card's tree is module state, and heavy
  cards routinely keep hidden plot flags in it — so leaves reach NO player panel until
  the Keeper exposes them: `.var expose <prefix|*>` puts a path (and its subtree) on
  the party's panel, `.var hide` takes it off, `.var list` shows the whole tree with
  visibility markers. The Keeper's own panel always shows everything (hidden leaves
  flagged). Tell your users which prefixes to expose — or ship that line in your
  pack's card `notes`.

## What's different here (read this before debugging)

Loreweaver is a game engine, not a chat frontend. The differences all follow from
that:

- **The dice are real.** `{{roll:XdY}}` is rolled by the dice engine; checks resolve
  through rules code. A card cannot pre-write an outcome ("the attack hits") into
  being — the engine rolls first, the model narrates the result.
- **Character numbers validate.** An imported card becomes a real sheet in the
  active rule system (CoC 7e or D&D 5e SRD), checked against the rulepack and held to its limits.
- **`{{char}}` is bound at import** — a card's character identity doesn't drift.
  `{{user}}` stays dynamic (whoever the active PC is at render time).
- **`{{time}}` / `{{date}}` are the game clock**, not the wall clock. Your
  "midnight" fires when it's midnight *in the story*.
- **`faker` is stubbed** (returns empty strings, logs a warning) — nondeterministic
  flavor text conflicts with reproducible sessions and is rarely load-bearing.
- **`@INJECT` message-index positioning is inert.** Loreweaver assembles one system
  prompt through its own prompt builder; there is no client-side message array to
  index into.
- **Status-bar / render entries import disabled.** `[RENDER:*]`, `@@render_*`,
  `@@iframe` are frontend features with no server-side meaning; those entries are
  kept but disabled so they never pollute a prompt. The replacements are the
  built-in tracker panel and [hooks](hooks.md) `emitUI` — which draws meters,
  badges and choice buttons in the actual client.
- **Without the `ejs` extra** (or with `TRPG_ENABLE_FULL_EJS=false`, or when a
  template throws), rendering falls back to a safe EJS subset: `<% if / else %>`
  chains, `<%= %>` outputs, `getvar()` / `variables.path` reads, `{{getvar::}}`
  macros, `@@if` conditions. The subset is **read-only** (template `setvar` is a
  no-op there), and fail-safe either way: raw template syntax never reaches the
  model.
- **Sandbox facts** (full mode): one fresh interpreter per turn — no cross-turn or
  cross-room state; hard memory cap and a per-eval time cap (an infinite loop times
  out instead of hanging the server); zero host I/O; buffered template writes capped
  per turn.

## The import trust boundary

An imported file doesn't get to pick its own privileges:

- **The card split is structural.** A player's character import cannot install hooks,
  seed the variable tree, or land executable templates — the machinery is stripped by
  deterministic code before anything touches room state, not filtered by a prompt.
  Only the Keeper's `world` import carries it in.
- **Scope is pinned** to the importing room — a card can't write global lore.
- **`constant` is forced off** for imported entries, for everyone. An always-on
  entry would let any card permanently occupy the prompt; imported lore activates
  by keyword and budget like everything else.
- **`secret` is honored only when a Keeper does the import** — an untrusted card
  cannot mint keeper-only lore.
- **Entry ids are regenerated**, so a card can't address (and overwrite) another
  card's entries.
- **Re-importing replaces** that Keeper-imported source's hooks and entries rather
  than stacking duplicates. The importer rebuilds the source's variable schema
  and preserves overlapping valid values, so progress is not reset merely because
  the source was refreshed. Importing a different world/prose module is a room
  module switch and replaces the previous module-owned content atomically. A
  player's character import remains additive and cannot displace module lore.

With full EJS enabled, world content runs code in the sandbox described above — that
is the point, and it is the operator's informed call: "your box, your cards" is the
**Keeper's** stance about the Keeper's own table, which is exactly why the world half
goes through the Keeper's hands. If you would rather nothing executed at all, set
`TRPG_ENABLE_FULL_EJS=false` or skips the `ejs` extra.
