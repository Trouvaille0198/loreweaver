"""Bounded retry for rate-limited / overloaded LLM calls (F22).

From a 2026-08-07 long session: a rate limit killed the Keeper at the story's
climax. A 429 is not a failure of the request — it is the provider saying "not
right now", and the only correct answer at a table is to wait a moment and ask
again. **A rate-limited turn should get SLOWER. It must never get dead.**

`RetryingLLM` wraps any `LLMClient` and re-issues a call that failed with a
retryable status (429, 5xx, "overloaded"): a few attempts, exponential backoff,
full jitter, every wait logged at WARNING so an operator watching the console can
see the table is throttled rather than hung. Anything else — a bad key, a
malformed request, a content refusal — propagates immediately and unchanged; a
retry loop around a permanent error is just a slower failure.

It wraps at :func:`infra.providers.build_llm`, so EVERY provider path gets it from
one implementation: the OpenAI-compatible client, the native Anthropic and Gemini
adapters, the ChatGPT/SuperGrok subscription paths, and the separately-built
Scribe and Director clients alike. Detection is by exception SHAPE rather than by
SDK class (`status_code`/`status`/`code`, then the message text), because the five
paths raise five different exception types for the same HTTP 429.

Two things worth knowing:

- **A streamed call is retried too, and its draft bubble briefly shows both
  attempts.** `on_text_delta` may already have emitted text when the provider gave
  up, and there is no un-emitting it. This is safe rather than merely tolerated:
  the protocol's closing `narrative` frame carries the FULL final text and REPLACES
  the draft (docs/protocol.md, "Streaming is two frame types with one rule"), so
  the doubling lasts until the turn ends and then disappears. `on_retry` is
  available for a caller that wants to say something in the meantime.
- **The total wait is bounded** (`MAX_ATTEMPTS` attempts, each capped at
  `MAX_DELAY`). A provider that is down for an hour should surface as an error the
  operator can act on, not as a turn that hangs until someone kills the server.
