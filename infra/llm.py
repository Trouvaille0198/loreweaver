    Exactly one of `responder`/`script` is normally supplied:
    - `script`: each `chat()` call pops and returns the next `ChatResult`,
      in order; calling past the end raises.
    - `responder`: each `chat()` call invokes `responder(messages, tools)`,
      letting a test inspect the running conversation and branch.
    Every call is recorded to `self.calls` as `(messages, tools)` so tests
    can assert on what the loop actually sent; the per-call `tool_choice` is
    recorded in parallel to `self.tool_choices` (it is otherwise ignored — the
    script/responder decides the reply), so a test can assert the loop forced a
    tool with `tool_choice="required"`.
