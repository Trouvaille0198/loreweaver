"""Resolve a `.lwpack` ref — local path / https direct link / ``gh:owner/repo[@tag]`` — to a
local file.

Git IS the registry: a ``gh:`` ref asks the GitHub API for a release's ``*.lwpack``
asset (``@tag`` pins a release; without it the latest release is used). That ONE
request — the release-metadata call this module builds itself, never a URL a caller
typed — is anonymous unless ``GITHUB_TOKEN``/``GH_TOKEN`` is set, in which case the
credential lifts the per-IP anonymous rate limit. Downloads (including the release
asset, which is served from another host) are always anonymous, and a cross-host
redirect drops the credential rather than forwarding it.
There is deliberately no central package registry. All network code lives here (infra
plumbing — ``core.pack`` stays offline-pure and re-validates every byte on inspect);
the ``fetch`` callable is injectable so tests run fully offline.
