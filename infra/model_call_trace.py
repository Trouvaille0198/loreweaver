"""Per-model-call accounting for the operator's probe (2026-08-21).

Every production model call passes through `infra.llm_retry.RetryingLLM.chat` — `build_llm`
wraps every provider path in it, the Scribe's and Director's dedicated clients included —
so that is where ONE row per LOGICAL call (retries included) is recorded: which lane asked,
how long it took wall-clock, how many attempts it took, and what the provider billed
(prompt / completion / cached tokens). The local run-3 play-test could recover per-call
latency only by reading the gaps between tool clusters in the tool trace, and the session's
46% cache-hit figure was the sum of every lane together: "which call is slow" and "does the
Keeper lane actually hit the cache" were unanswerable. A probe that cannot answer where the
time went is not a probe (the same lesson the image warm-up taught a day earlier).

Shape:
- a lane is declared by the code that ASSEMBLES the prompt (`lane_scope("npc", npc=...)`
  around its call), which is also the iron-rule-5 assembler — so the row names the lane by
  construction, and a nested lane (an NPC voiced inside a Keeper round) restores the outer
  scope when it returns;
- `infra/` cannot import `agent/`, so the sink is pluggable: `agent.tool_trace` installs
  one that writes into the same JSONL the tool probe uses (`tool: "model_call"`), and with
  no sink installed the whole thing costs one ContextVar read per call.
