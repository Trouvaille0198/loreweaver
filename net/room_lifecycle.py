"""The one place every room-lifecycle facet is collected (M23 WS1).

`infra.room_facets` defines what a facet IS; the owner modules declare them; this module
is where they become a registry the four lifecycle operations can walk. The module list
is explicit rather than discovered by scanning the package tree: an import that only
happens when some other code path happens to have imported the owner first is a registry
that silently shrinks. `tests/architecture/test_room_facets.py` compares this list against
every module in the repo that declares `ROOM_FACETS`, so forgetting to add one is a red
build rather than a room that quietly keeps state forever.

Ordering note: the registry answers WHAT a facet owns. `net/room_backup.py` keeps
answering in which segment, and in which order, each operation acts on it.
