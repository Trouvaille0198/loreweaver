"""Transport-neutral session core for the networked TUI.

The join handshake's identity resolution, the per-turn choke (`dispatch_input`), the frame
dispatch (`_on_frame`), history replay, the room `AgentCtx`, and the frame builders live here —
everything that is the SAME regardless of the wire. A transport (`net.iroh_server`) only supplies
a `Member` that can `send_frame` + `deliver`, and drives `SessionCore` per connection.

The wire protocol itself is in `docs/protocol.md`. `SessionCore` owns the shared `RoomHub`,
command router, toolset, censor and rate limiter, so every transport fans out through one bus —
a p2p player and (historically) a chat member sit at the same live table.
