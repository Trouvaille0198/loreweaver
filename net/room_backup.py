# --- `.reset` scope groups -----------------------------------------------------
# M17: room CONTENT lives in the documents table and room-scoped RUNTIME state in
# the room_state table — both room-scoped by COLUMN, so backup/export/delete simply
# dump whole rooms and need NO per-store key allowlist (the drift bug class died
# with the KV era). What remains is the SEMANTIC partition `.reset` scopes need:
# which document types and which runtime keys each scope wipes.
#
# M23 WS1 moved that partition OUT of this file. It used to be four hand-maintained
# frozensets here, and they drifted from the code that wrote the state three times in
# one month. Now each family is declared as a `RoomStateFacet` BY the module that owns
# it (`infra/room_facets.py`, collected in `net/room_lifecycle.py`), an architecture
# test fails the build on state no facet claims, and this file asks the registry.
# Room SETTINGS (language, house rules, enabled skills/presets/panels, media/bot
# toggles) are configuration rather than campaign content, so their facets declare
# `reset_scope=None` and survive every level.
#
# What did NOT move: the order the legs run in and what happens when one fails. Those
# stay here, with the operations.

# Which snapshot section carries each room-scoped storage. The export manifest is built
# from this map, so a storage a facet lives in cannot quietly go uncarried — the
# architecture test requires every facet storage to appear here or to be export-exempt,
# and an export-exempt storage must be CLEARED on import (below) instead. A load is a
# whole-room checkpoint: each carried storage is replaced, not merged, so live rows the
# snapshot does not name disappear with the export-exempt ones. The one exception is the
# KV section: `bound_room.*` rows are wiring, not campaign content, so — like bearer keys
# — they are restored, never deleted (see `import_room`).
