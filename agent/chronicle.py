"""The campaign chronicle, generative half (M18) — the fold flow.

`core.chronicle` holds the deterministic policy (document types, projections,
hysteresis levels, the no-future watermark); this module is the LLM-driven flow
on top of it:

- `maybe_fold_chronicle` — the per-turn hook (wired into `agent.loop.run_kp_turn`
  BEFORE prompt assembly, so both the 0.60 trigger and the 0.85 emergency fold
  land before the next model call). Read from the room's `usage_stats` meter —
  last turn's prompt size, a reactive measurement rather than a prediction.
  Normally that is the provider's own count; for an endpoint that reports none
  it is `agent.loop`'s estimate of the same prompt, flagged as such, because a
  meter that is merely ABSENT reads as "no pressure" and would leave the fold —
  emergency level included — permanently inert. Batch-folds the oldest chronicle
  records into the rolling `campaign_summary` until as many tokens as the floor
  needs have left the prompt, bounded by a per-turn batch budget.
  What a fold actually FREES is replayed HISTORY: writing
  `campaign_summary.through_turn` is what lets `agent.history.trim_folded` stop
  replaying every turn at or below it, and that is the whole of a fold's effect
  on the prompt (the summary itself is bounded and the section renders no raw
  records). So both the gate and the batch sizing are solved in that unit —
  `_history_tokens_through`, the `estimate_tokens` sum over the messages a fold
  through a given turn would drop — rather than by summing the folded records'
  own sizes, which measure text that was never in the prompt twice.
  When history cannot cover the deficit at all, the fold takes everything it
  has — the spec's small-window edge, "fold does its best".
  What remains approximate is only the UNIT: the meter is the provider's
  tokenizer over the whole prompt, `_history_tokens_through` is
  `estimate_tokens` over the replayed messages, and folded records can flow back
  in through topical recall. So both guards stay — a routine fold does not run
  when there is no replayed history left for it to free, and does not re-arm
  until the measured meter actually grows past the reading the previous fold
  acted on. Neither is redundant now that the arithmetic is honest: they answer
  "did this fold pay for itself" from the meter, which is the only authority on
  that. Synchronous by design: a fire-and-forget fold could race the NEXT turn's
  prompt assembly, and folds are rare by hysteresis. Best-effort throughout — a
  fold failure never breaks a turn.
- `record_entry` — the append path behind the `record_chronicle` tool. Entries
  are stamped with the in-progress turn index (counter + 1); the tool accepts
  no turn parameter, so nothing can be recorded speculatively (past-only).
- `build_chronicle_sections` — the prompt injection, split at the same cache
  boundary `agent.prompt_builder` is: the campaign summary (+ its keeper margin)
  rides the STABLE head, open threads and the topically recalled folded records
  ride the volatile tail. No raw unfolded tail is rendered at all: an unfolded
  record's turn is above `through_turn` by construction, so its turn's verbatim
  history is still being replayed and rendering it would put the same events in
  the prompt twice. KP-grade: this is the Keeper's own system prompt, so keeper
  annotations ride along (they never cross `project()` on player surfaces).
- `render_recap` — the player-facing "previously on…", rendered ONLY from
  player projections, so it is spoiler-free by construction.
- folded records join the embedding index (collection "chronicle", the
  worldbook payload scheme) so old history stays topically retrievable —
  chronicle and worldbook never mix stores; they meet only in retrieval.

The fold input is the records' public `text` ONLY — keeper annotations never
enter the fold prompt, so a chatty summarizer cannot copy a secret into the
player-facing summary. Annotations survive in the entry documents themselves
(keeper-side, retrievable), and the summary's `keeper` margin is written by no
fold — it is keeper-editable (`.chronicle note`) and preserved verbatim across
regenerations.
