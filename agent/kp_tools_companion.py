"""AI-KP tools for AI *player companions* (`docs/specs/M10-companions.md` §5).

`CompanionTools` is the function-calling surface for creating and steering AI party members. A
companion is a PLAYER-side character: `add_companion` creates a `player_companion`
`agent.npc.NpcRecord` AND a real `core.character_manager.CharacterSheet` under the virtual user_key
`companion:{id}`, so the KP's normal `skill_check`/character tools resolve REAL dice on the
companion's own sheet when it takes a turn.

The heavy lifting -- generating a companion's action under strict information isolation, then running
it through the normal turn pipeline so the KP resolves real dice -- lives in
`agent.companion_actor` + `gateway.director`. These tools are the thin CRUD/steering layer over
`agent.npc` (document-backed records); every user-visible string is looked up via `services.i18n` under
`companion.tools.*` (`locales/{en,zh}/companion.json`). Companion persona/knowledge/names are game
DATA supplied at runtime, not literals here, so they need no i18n of their own (same convention as
`agent.kp_tools_npc`).

`companion_act` is the one tool that can drive a live turn: when the KP toolset was built WITH a hub
(the shared-room path), it delegates to `gateway.director.request_companion`; otherwise it degrades
to declaring the companion's action for the KP to weave and adjudicate. A companion turn never
re-enters this tool (the director builds companion turns a hub-less toolset), and the tool itself
refuses to run while already inside a companion turn.
