"""The replayed conversation history, as an append-only tree (M20 D).

Before this, `chat_history` was one JSON list in `room_state`, overwritten every turn.
Rewinding it meant rewriting it, and a rewrite is a thing you cannot take back. Now each
message is a row naming its parent, and "where the conversation is" is a single pointer:
**a rewind is a pointer move, and a branch costs nothing** — the abandoned turns stay on
disk, simply not on the current path.

The loop reads the chain from the leaf and writes two records per turn (the player's
message and the final reply), so the wire layout M20 A depends on is unchanged: the same
messages, in the same order, byte-identical between folds.

**Conversation is only half of a room's state**, and that is why this module is not the
whole of Stage D. A turn's tool calls also write documents (NPC records, modvars, the MVU
tree, sheets), room_state (clock, scene, relationship tracks) and chronicle entries.
Rewinding only the conversation produces the worst kind of inconsistency: both halves
self-consistent, the whole a hallucination. `agent/undo.py` carries the other half.
