"""The prep-phase script hatch as a Keeper tool (M20 F).

`core.prep_script` turns a script into a PLAN; this is where the plan meets the engine.
Every operation goes through `Toolset.dispatch`, which means it goes through exactly the
same argument coercion, `keeper_only` marking, `gated` unlock check and `prep_only` phase
check a model-issued call does — because it IS that code, not a parallel copy of it.

Two things this deliberately does not do:

- It does not run in the play phase. The tool is `prep_only`, so it is not even offered
  there, and `dispatch` refuses it a second time if the name is called blind.
- It does not reach commands. `.import … world` and `.var expose` are keeper COMMANDS,
  and a plan can only name tools — so the 拆卡 doctrine's two keeper-only affordances stay
  outside the script-reachable surface by construction rather than by an exclusion list
  someone has to remember to update.
