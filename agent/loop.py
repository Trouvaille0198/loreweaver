"""The AI-KP multi-round function-calling loop.

Per the M1 spec (``docs/specs/M1.md`` §6.5), one player turn is driven as:
build the system prompt, replay a capped window of prior turn history from
the store, then repeatedly call ``services.llm.chat(...)`` with the
toolset's schemas attached. Every round that comes back with tool calls is
dispatched through ``toolset.dispatch`` and fed back as ``role="tool"``
messages (recorded to ``tool_trace`` for auditing/tests); the first round
that comes back with no tool calls supplies the final reply. If
``max_rounds`` is exhausted without ever reaching a plain-text reply, one
tools-disabled finalizer narrates the already-committed public tool results.
Only if that finalizer fails is a localized deterministic fallback used.

Only the user message and the final assistant reply are persisted back to
history — never the intermediate tool-call chatter — so replayed history
stays lean across turns. A keeper-only tool's raw result is recorded in
``tool_trace`` for inspection, but it only ever enters the conversation as a
``role="tool"`` message; it is never surfaced as-is as ``reply`` (the model
must transform it first, per the keeper-secrecy discipline block the system
prompt carries — see ``agent/prompt_builder.py``).

=====================================================================
THE MAP — read this before changing anything below
=====================================================================

This module is the most paid-for code in the repo: nearly every block below
exists because a live session broke without it, and the fix's reason is in
the comment next to it. The line-level comments say WHY each piece is there;
this section says HOW THE PIECES FIT, which is the thing a reader cannot
recover from any one of them. Do not split this file for readability alone
(owner ruling 2026-08-19): the pieces are kept together because their ORDER
is the contract.

How one turn runs (``run_kp_turn``), in order — every step depends on the
ones above it:

 1. Reset per-turn residue on the (reused) ``AgentCtx``: dice payloads, NPC
    lines, ``hook_injections`` / ``clock_advances`` / ``variable_writes``.
 2. Fire the ``turn_start`` hook BEFORE prompt assembly — its injections and
    variable writes must shape this very prompt.
 3. Adopt legacy history (``migrate_legacy_blob``), then run the routine
    chronicle fold (``maybe_fold_chronicle``) — also BEFORE assembly, so the
    emergency ceiling keeps headroom for the fold's own generation.
 4. Fix this turn's tool catalog ONCE: ``unlocked`` (skills), ``phase``
    (prep/play), ``capabilities`` (room stores), ``room_pack`` subsystem
    tools. Every schema build and every dispatch this turn uses the same
    four values, so what is offered and what is refused can never disagree.
 5. Assemble the prompt (``_assemble_base``): stable head as ONE system
    message with a cache breakpoint; replayed history (trimmed to what the
    fold has absorbed); the volatile state tail as a USER message headed as
    engine state; the player line. One assembler, one object (iron rule #5);
    two wire slots for cache behavior (M20 A1).
 6. Stamp ``turn_index`` (= completed turns + 1, the same stamp chronicle
    records use), heal a crashed prior attempt's dangling leaf (NOT inside a
    companion sub-turn), write down the hook injections (M23 WS3), and
    persist the PLAYER message NOW — so a nested companion turn appends its
    exchange between the player's line and the reply, the order the table saw.
 7. The round loop: ``chat`` → if tool calls, ``_dispatch_and_record`` and go
    again; else the content is the reply. A context overflow — refusal OR a
    reply truncated at the window — folds once and retries ONCE
    (``_recover_from_overflow``); any other provider error returns a
    localized diagnosis WITHOUT persisting the turn (the player line is
    abandoned back off the path).
 8. End-of-turn checks (``_run_turn_checks``): the pack-declared Stop-form
    table, re-verified after every re-ask, bounded by
    ``MAX_ROUNDS_PER_TURN``; a tool round inside a check is not the end
    (the narration that reads the real roll is).
 9. If ``max_rounds`` ran out with no plain reply: one tools-disabled
    finalizer over the public committed results, else the deterministic
    fallback.
10. Reply post-processing, in THIS order: MVU ``<UpdateVariable>`` blocks
    applied + stripped (deterministic code does the bookkeeping) → text-shaped
    tool calls stripped → reply hooks (``apply``/``reply`` phases) →
    ``output_review`` (the censor sees final text) → stream gate drained.
11. Persist the reply, advance the chronicle counter, photograph the room for
    undo (``capture_snapshot`` AFTER the counter, so snapshot ``turn_index``
    is the end-of-turn state), fill an estimated prompt size if the provider
    reported none.

Invariants a change here must keep (each one was paid for — see the comment
at the site, and ``docs/defensive-patterns.md``):

 * ``messages`` is mutated IN PLACE for the whole turn and never rebound: the
   provider's continuation state (``_clear_llm_continuation``) is keyed by the
   list's identity. The overflow rebuild splices (``messages[:] = ...``).
 * Cache breakpoints are wire-only marks on COPIES; the persisted chain never
   carries ``CACHE_BREAKPOINT_KEY``. Exactly one breakpoint rides the newest
   tool result (``_move_in_turn_breakpoint``); calls that leave the main
   prefix (checks, finalizer) strip the marks.
 * The overflow retry is at most once per KP turn and only if the fold FOLDED
   something — no progress, no retry (the ping-pong guard). The retry is
   budgeted as +1 round, not as a tool round.
 * Provider errors never crash a turn and never persist one; cancellation
   (``asyncio.CancelledError``) always releases continuation state before it
   propagates.
 * Tool calls in one round run concurrently only inside a RUN of calls that
   cannot touch the same document: ``read_only`` tools, and tools declaring
   ``concurrent_by=<arg>`` whose keys differ (``speak_as_npc`` by ``npc``; its one
   shared write, the intent note, takes a per-room lock). Any other writer is a
   barrier, and ``companion_act`` — a nested turn — always is. Recording and
   publishing stay in CALL order; only the execution overlaps
   (``_concurrency_groups``, ``capture_npc_lines``).
 * The stream gate is fail-closed: text leaves for the client only once it can
   no longer become part of a machinery/MVU block; a tool round's draft is
   discarded; the final ``narrative`` frame is authoritative. Streaming the
   final draft happens BEFORE the check lane so a corrective roll can close it.
 * Tool results are capped (``MAX_TOOL_RESULT_CHARS``) and the cut is ANNOUNCED
   to the model — a silent cut makes it answer from half a document.
 * Nothing here is a new model-call lane: the turn's budget is
   ``AGENTS.md`` "Per-turn model-call budget", pinned by
   ``tests/agent/test_turn_call_budget.py``. The check runner's calls are
   deliberately NOT folded into the headline usage.
 * Hook failures never break a turn; hook emissions are capped
   (``MAX_PANEL_EVENTS_PER_TURN``).
 * ``ctx.platform == "companion"`` marks a NESTED turn: no dangling-leaf heal,
   no Scribe/Director (those guards live in ``gateway/turn.py`` and
   ``gateway/director.py``), and it deliberately does NOT take the room's
   turn lock — that is what keeps it from self-deadlocking.

Traps (things that look like small improvements and are not):

 * "This round also needs to do one small thing" — a new per-turn step goes
   in the phase list above or in ``agent/turn_checks`` (the declarative
   table), not as a sixth ad-hoc branch in the round loop.
 * Folding the check runner's usage into ``turn_usage`` (it is a bounded
   repair pass, and the meter drives the fold).
 * Re-ordering step 11: the reply is persisted FIRST (it carries this turn's
   stamp), the counter advances SECOND, the undo snapshot is taken LAST
   (before the counter it would be named one turn off).
 * Reading a chronicle/turn index AFTER ``run_kp_turn`` returns by re-reading
   the counter — take it from ``KPTurnResult.turn`` (M21 trap).
 * Re-ordering step 10: the censor must see what the player will see.

    as `(0, 0)` to `agent.chronicle._read_meter`, a zero window short-circuits the
    fold, and the room's history never trims — including at the 0.85 emergency level.
    "No number" is the one answer the fold cannot act on, so a rough number beats it.

    Sized in `core.chronicle.estimate_tokens`, which is CJK-aware and is the unit the
    fold's own cost model already speaks, over BOTH halves of what was actually sent:
    the final round's messages (the same last-wins semantics `_accumulate_usage` gives
    a measured reading) and the JSON tool catalog, which is a large fixed share of
    every KP prompt and would otherwise be invisible. It is still only a rough count,
    and rough in both directions — it sees no per-message framing or vendor preamble,
    while a heuristic tuned to be safe on CJK can outrun a vendor's own tokenizer. So
    it is never quietly passed off as a measurement: `Usage.estimated` rides with it
    into the store, and the fold refuses to compare it against a measured reading.

    A no-op the moment any round reported a real prompt count, so a provider that
    reports usage never sees this path at all.

    `agent.turn_checks` for the table, the conditions, and why the form is Stop rather
    than a forced tool call.

    Three properties are load-bearing:

    * **It re-verifies.** After every re-ask the condition is evaluated again on the NEW
      reply. Refusing to end the turn is only different from asking nicely because of this
      loop — a single nudge with no follow-up is the escape hatch the old design shipped.
    * **A tool round is not the end.** When the model answers by calling a tool (rolling
      the dice it forged), the loop keeps going for the narration that reads the real
      result. Breaking there would leave the invented numbers standing.
    * **The prefix is untouched.** `tools` and `tool_choice` stay exactly as the main loop
      sent them, so the checks — which run when the context is at its largest — read the
      same cached prefix instead of paying to recompute it.

    Best-effort throughout: any provider error keeps the reply as it stands. Its chat
    calls are deliberately NOT folded into the turn's headline usage.
