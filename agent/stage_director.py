"""The Stage Director (演出导演) — the player-side presentation actor (M19).

Born from the K3×K3 live test: the single moment a naive player scored "the only
thing all session where the picture said more than the text" was a handout image,
and her report asked for more. The presentation layer is the surface players
actually look at, and until now it was either static pack content or the operator
performing beats by hand (`.bgm` switches, copying handout files). This is the
actor that performs them.

**Scoped by construction — the load-bearing design point.** Everything this actor
emits is player-visible, so it joins the knowledge-scoped actor family (the
NPC/companion precedent, iron rule #3): its inputs are the PROJECTED player-visible
stream plus the module's presentation kit, and nothing else. It cannot leak what it
never receives. Concretely, its whole context is:

- the player's own utterance and the Keeper's reply — both ALREADY broadcast to the
  room as `narrative` frames, so neither can carry anything a player has not read;
- ``PLAYER_VIEWER`` projections only (scene, player-visible trackers);
- the presentation kit (`gateway.presentation`), which is authored player-facing
  production notes by definition.

The beat cue from the Scribe is an ENUM, never prose. The Scribe is a keeper-side
actor that reads keeper trackers; letting it hand the Director a written summary
would be a covert channel straight out of the keeper half, however well-meant. So
场记 says only WHICH KIND of moment this is, and the Director reconstructs what
happened from the player-visible stream it already holds.
`tests/architecture/test_director_isolation.py` is the oracle for all of this.

**Boundaries.** The Director never writes fiction (the KP's), never rolls or
adjudicates (the engine's), never reads keeper knowledge. It decides WHAT TO SHOW
and WHEN — a theater director does not rewrite the script mid-performance.

Three output lanes, each validated by deterministic code before it reaches anyone:

1. ``blocks`` — performance templates, through the SAME `core.hooks` sanitizer that
   validates hook emissions. The Director picks the template and the words; it never
   welds the stage.
2. ``audio`` — cue ids the kit declares, resolved to real pack assets and broadcast
   as ordinary `audio_control` frames. An id the kit does not declare is dropped.
3. ``image`` — one generation request per beat, under the kit's discipline:
   ref-mandatory (no 定妆 reference → no portrait, structurally: the Director can
   only name subjects the kit declares), 宁缺毋滥 (an author's ``generation:
   pack_only`` silences it entirely), and a per-room budget. ``prepare`` warms
   likely-next subjects in the background — 慢菜先备, so a beat serves art that was
   cooked during the quiet turns before it.

- You never narrate, never roll, never decide outcomes, never speak as a character. You choose a FORM and fill it from what the table has already seen.
- Write in the language the turn is written in. Match the module's period and register; a 1925 newspaper does not sound like a modern one.
- Emit nothing rather than something generic. An empty "blocks" list is a fine answer for a beat that needs only music.
- "audio": only cue ids listed below. "image": at most one, subject id from the list below, and its prompt must describe ONLY what players have already seen or could plainly see now.
- "prepare": subject ids you expect to want a picture of within the next scene or two (0-{pregen} of them). They are generated quietly in advance; naming one costs nothing now.
