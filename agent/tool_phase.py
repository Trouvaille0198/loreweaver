"""Which tool phase a room is in (M20 B) — `prep` or `play`.

The Keeper's 76 tools are not all wanted at once. The axis that separates them is
**bulk / low-frequency vs improvisational**: authoring a module-grade NPC, importing a
lorebook, defining a variable, exporting a report are things a keeper does in a sitting
before or between sessions; rolling a check, voicing an NPC, moving the clock are things
that happen every turn. `prep_only` on `@tool` marks the first kind; this module answers
"which phase is this room in right now" so the loop can drop them during play.

The axis is deliberately NOT "prep-type work". Improvising a shopkeeper mid-scene is
ordinary play, and a keeper flipping phase to rescue one improvised line would BE the
ceremony the split is supposed to remove — so the light `sketch_npc` counterpart lives in
both phases. That also keeps iron rule #3 intact: no record means no knowledge-scoped
actor, so an NPC voiced without one would have nowhere to keep its private knowledge.

**Where the default comes from.** An unset room follows its own recorded lifecycle rather
than a guess about intent: a room whose module has not finished initializing is still
being built, so it reads as `prep` (which is where the bulk tools belong, and it is what
makes a brand-new room work with no ceremony at all); once `module_init_status` reaches
ready, the room reads as `play`. A keeper's explicit `.phase` choice is a pin and always
wins — including pinning a never-initialized freeform room to `play`.
