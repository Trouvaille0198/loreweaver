"""Layer B.3 — the KP self-extension engines ("a skill that creates skills/rule systems/modules").

See ``docs/plugins.md`` "Layer B". Three generators share one shape: ask the room's LLM to author
a complete artifact for a natural-language description, validate the result through the SAME
parser real discovery/ingestion uses -- writing NOTHING until that succeeds -- then install it and
make it immediately live.

- `generate_and_install_skill` (B.3a) -- a ``SKILL.md`` bundle, validated via
  `core.skills.parse_skill_text`, installed under `core.skills._USER_SKILL_DIR`.
- `generate_and_install_rulepack` (B.3b) -- a flat ``<id>.yaml`` rulepack, validated via
  `core.rulepacks.parse_rulepack_text` (including its `derived:` section compiling through the
  safe DSL), installed under `core.rulepacks._USER_RULEPACK_DIR`.
- `generate_and_install_module` (B.3b) -- a Markdown module/scenario document, installed as a flat
  ``<id>.md`` file under `_USER_MODULE_DIR` and then run through the EXISTING module-ingestion
  pipeline (`agent.kp_tools_knowledge.DocumentTools.upload_document`) so it lands in the CALLING
  room's own knowledge pool -- unlike the other two, this is per-room content, not a new global
  discovery registry.

Trust boundary (``docs/plugins.md`` "The trust boundary"): all three are still **data plugins**
even though the model wrote them -- no code ever runs. Nothing here `eval`/`exec`s anything; a
skill/rulepack is parsed with `yaml.safe_load` (via `core.yaml_safety.safe_load_no_aliases`, which
additionally rejects alias/anchor nodes -- an alias-bomb document can expand into an exponential
in-memory structure once something stringifies it) exactly like a hand-authored one, and a module
is opaque Markdown text handed to the same analysis pipeline a manual upload uses. LLM-authored
skill/rulepack content is ALSO capped at `_MAX_FORGE_CONTENT_BYTES` before that first parse call --
independent, defense-in-depth protection against a merely large (non-aliased) document costing
real CPU/memory on the shared event loop. The one privileged operation each performs is a scoped
filesystem write, confined by construction (`_confined_target`/`_confined_file_target` assert the
resolved path never escapes its directory) and gated behind a `generate_*` tool
(`agent.kp_tools_forge`), each itself gated (Layer B.2) and invisible until its forge skill unlocks
it.
