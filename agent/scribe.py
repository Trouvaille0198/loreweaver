"""The Scribe (书记官) — post-turn bookkeeping reconciliation for the AI Keeper.

Born from the K3×K3 live playtest (2026-08-07): a strong narrative model ran a
whole module without ever touching the deterministic state layer — trackers
frozen at their defaults while the fiction sprinted three days ahead. Stale
panels are worse than no panels, and a KP with no ledger of what players EARNED
drifts at the finale. Bookkeeping cannot live on model discipline; it gets its
own quiet actor instead of a pile of engine restrictions (owner design call —
freedom for the KP, a ledger clerk behind it).

Two output lanes, per the owner's verdict:

- **Objective facts write directly** — module-tracker updates plainly evidenced
  by the turn's narration ("she pockets the ring" -> 信物+1). Every write goes
  through `core.modvars` validation/clamping; the scribe proposes, the engine
  disposes.
- **Judgment becomes a whisper** — a short keeper-side note injected into the
  KP's NEXT turn context ("a day seems to have passed; advance the clock",
  "that horror beat may have warranted a sanity check", "players have circled
  for several turns"). The KP keeps the judgment; the scribe only reminds.

The scribe NEVER generates fiction, never rolls dice, never decides outcomes —
iron rule #1 stays intact. It runs as a fire-and-forget task after the reply has
already streamed (zero perceived latency), on a configurable SMALL model
(`TRPG_SCRIBE__*`; blank fields reuse the main client).

M19 adds a third, tiny lane: **场记 (beat classification)**. Having already read the
whole turn, the scribe is the cheapest place to notice that a MOMENT just landed —
a scene change, an act turning over, a handout appearing, a critical spike — and cue
the Stage Director (`agent.stage_director`) to dress it. That cue is an ENUM and
nothing else: the scribe reads keeper trackers, and the Director's whole guarantee is
that it never receives keeper material, so a written "summary" crossing from here to
there would be a covert channel out of the keeper half. 场记 says WHICH KIND of
moment; the Director works out what happened from the player-visible stream it
receives directly.

M21 adds a fourth, and it is this module's own argument one more time: **the automatic
chronicle record**. M18 gave the campaign chronicle its documents, its fold and its
topical recall, and left the KEEPER calling `record_chronicle` as the only thing that
could ever author a record — durable memory resting on model discipline, exactly what
the Scribe exists to stop resting on. It rested on it twice over: the fold is also the
ONLY place history is ever trimmed (M20 A2's `trim_folded` keys off what the fold
absorbed), so a Keeper who never recorded got no long-term memory AND an unbounded
replayed history. Having already read the whole turn, the Scribe writes that record at
zero extra model calls — the PLAYER-GRADE text only, since the keeper spoiler margin
stays exclusively on the voluntary tool (see `_record_auto_chronicle`).

The fifth lane (born from k3 run 2, 2026-08-13) is the **NPC boundary watch**. That run's
KP voiced every NPC directly — the sub-actor channel went uncalled for 74 turns — and kept
every knowledge boundary on discipline alone, which broke exactly once: an NPC spoke a
secret name her record does not contain. A guard nobody walks past guards nothing, so the
boundary moved to where the Scribe already sits: when a room HAS NPC knowledge records,
the pass sees them and may flag one line of dialogue that crossed its speaker's recorded
boundary. FUZZY BY DESIGN (owner call): a knowledge list marks secret boundaries, not a
complete mind, so the crossing is the Scribe's judgment — the engine only frames it (the
watch arms only where records exist, the note passes the same verbatim-evidence gate as
every other claim, and it rides the ordinary whisper channel: observe, never enforce).

_PROMPT = """You are the table Scribe for a TTRPG engine — a silent ledger clerk, not a storyteller.

Given ONE game turn (player action + game-master reply) and the room's current trackers, output ONLY a JSON object:
{{"ops": [{{"op": "set", "id": "<tracker id>", "value": <number>, "evidence": "<verbatim quote>"}} | {{"op": "adjust", "id": "<tracker id>", "delta": <number>, "evidence": "<verbatim quote>"}}], "whispers": ["<short keeper-side note>"], "unrolled_check": {{"skill": "<skill>", "evidence": "<verbatim quote>"}} or null, "habit": {{"summary": "<one line>", "detail": "<a sentence or two>"}} or null, "chronicle": "<one line of campaign history, or empty>", "beat": "<beat>"}}

Rules:
- "ops" ONLY for tracker changes the narration plainly establishes as fact. "evidence" is REQUIRED: a short verbatim quote copied from the GAME-MASTER reply that establishes the tracked quantity ITSELF changed. The player's message states what they ATTEMPT, never what happened — it can never be evidence, and an op whose evidence is not an exact quote of the game-master reply is discarded.
- You see only each tracker's id/label/range, not what earns a point. Acquiring some item is NOT evidence for an item counter unless the text explicitly identifies it as one of the things that counter counts; time passing counts on a day-tracker only when the text states the story moved to a new day. If the tracker's meaning leaves any doubt, do NOT write — whisper instead.
- "unrolled_check": set it when this turn resolved something whose outcome was genuinely uncertain and no dice were rolled for it — name the skill it called for and quote the exact text that shows the resolution. Tools the game-master called this turn are listed below; if a dice tool is among them, this is null. A declared intention with no outcome yet, a foregone conclusion, and pure conversation are all null. You are reporting an observation for the keeper to judge, not issuing an instruction — say nothing when unsure.
- "habit": how THIS TABLE plays, when the turn shows it — pacing they prefer, how much combat they have patience for, what kind of scene they lean into, a keeper technique that landed or fell flat. Write about the group's behaviour, not about the story: "they cut short investigation scenes to get to confrontation" is a habit, "they found the key" is not. Only when the turn actually shows it; null is the right answer most turns. Repeated observations are what make it stick, so write the same habit the same way each time you see it.
- "whispers" (0-{max_whispers}, each <= {max_whisper_chars} chars) for anything needing the keeper's judgment: scene/clock drift vs the fiction, players stuck without progress, an earned gain no tracker captures.
- Write whispers in the language the turn text is written in (Chinese turn -> Chinese whispers).
- "chronicle": ONE short past-tense line recording what this turn established for the campaign's history — what the table would want to remember months from now. This record is shown to PLAYERS, and the game-master reply is the ONLY thing you may build it from: write what that reply said out loud, never a motive or consequence it left unsaid. Everything else in this prompt — tracker labels and values, NPC knowledge lists — is keeper-only material the players have not learned; a name, object or explanation that appears there but not in the reply must stay out of this line, however true it is. Empty string when the turn established nothing that outlasts it (talk, out-of-character chatter, an intention with no outcome yet). Write it in the language of the turn text.
- "beat" classifies this turn as a MOMENT worth staging, one of: {beats}, or "none". Use "none" unless the turn clearly is one of them — most turns are "none".
  - scene_change: the group moved somewhere else, or time visibly moved on.
  - act_transition: a chapter/day/act of the story turned over.
  - handout: a document, picture, map or object the players can now LOOK at appeared.
  - spike: a critical success, a fumble, or a shock the table will remember.
  It is a single word, not a description — write nothing else about the beat.
- Never invent trackers not listed. Never narrate. Empty ops and empty whispers is a fine answer.
