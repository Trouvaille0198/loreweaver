"""End-of-turn structural checks (M20 C) — the table, the conditions, and the runner.

What this replaces: two hand-written corrective phases of identical shape, plus 21
compiled regexes in `agent/loop.py` that tried to guess whether a player's sentence had
attempted something checkable. That guess was the wrong tool in the wrong box — a gate
built on a heuristic cannot see that heuristic's blind spots, and the metric that watched
it shared the same lexicon, so it confirmed itself. The judgement "should this have been
rolled?" needs the fiction read, so it belongs to the Scribe (`agent/scribe.py`), which
reads the fiction anyway and reports it as a whisper the Keeper is free to act on.

What is left here is only what can be decided WITHOUT reading the fiction:

- **forgery** — the reply states a roll-shaped result and no dice tool ran this turn, so
  there is no true value to compare against. Shape detection, which means a residual
  ambiguity band: ordinary prose does contain numbers. It is a large improvement over
  guessing intent, and it is NOT exact — `tests/agent/test_turn_checks.py` writes the
  tolerance down rather than pretending it away.
- **contradiction** — dice DID run, and the numbers in the prose disagree with them. This
  one is exact: normalize the numerals (Arabic and CJK), and compare against the totals,
  targets and faces this turn actually produced.
- **stale HUD** — the reply drew a scene/time heading but the turn never touched the
  deterministic scene/clock state the HUD reads.
- **item forgery** — the reply claims that a character received, acquired, equipped or
    used an item, but no item mutation tool successfully committed that change.

Both dice checks exist because of one contract: **narration carries no roll numbers.**
The dice frames already carry them (`gateway/render_chat.py`, `clients/tui`), so a number
in prose is at best a duplicate and at worst a duplicate that DISAGREES with the roll.

## The runner is pure Stop form

The gate refuses to end the turn and feeds the reason back; the model corrects itself. It
does NOT mutate `tools` or `tool_choice`. That is not squeamishness about forcing: the
correctives run at the END of a turn, when the prefix is at its largest, and on Anthropic
changing `tools` invalidates all three cache layers while changing `tool_choice`
invalidates the message layer — so the old `tool_choice="required"` path paid for a full
recompute up to five times per turn, at exactly the moment M20 A had made the prefix big.

Two properties make Stop form safe, and both are load-bearing:

1. **It loops and re-verifies.** "I will not let this turn end" only differs from "please
   roll" because the structural condition is re-run after each re-ask, up to the cap.
2. **The nightly dice-miss metric watches the assumption.** A soft nudge with an escape
   hatch was historically declined by the real Keeper on every occasion. Stop form is
   structurally different (the turn does not end) and, post-C1, the condition is
   verifiable rather than hoped for — but that is an empirical claim, and if the metric
   regresses, escalating the FINAL attempt to `required` is one added tier, not a
   redesign.
