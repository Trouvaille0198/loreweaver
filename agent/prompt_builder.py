"""Assembles the AI-KP system prompt for one turn from the ``core.prompt_sections``
section builders.

**Section order is STABLE HEAD → VOLATILE TAIL (P1, 2026-08-07).** Every section
still lands in ONE system prompt (iron rule #5 is untouched); only their order
changed, and it changed for a measurable reason. The 1.x order opened with the
archived-session recap and game state — the two things that change every single
turn — so each turn invalidated the whole downstream prefix: the module pool, the
rulepack expertise, the style layer and the skill bodies were re-read from scratch
every time, at full price. A 2026-08-07 long session burned 40% of a weekly quota
partly this way.

So the assembly is now two explicit halves (see :class:`SystemPrompt`):

- **stable head** — TRPG identity, system expertise, interaction style, the module
  knowledge pool, the preset layer, the enabled skill bodies, and the M18 rolling
  campaign summary (+ its keeper margin). These change when the ROOM's configuration
  changes (a module loads, a keeper enables a skill), or — for the summary — when a
  chronicle fold runs. This is the cacheable prefix.
- **volatile tail** — world lore (retrieval-dependent), live game state, relationship
  tracks, module variables, MVU leaves, scribe whispers, hook injections, and the rest
  of the M18 chronicle section (open threads + records recalled against this turn),
  which closes the tail.

Two properties were deliberately preserved through the move:

- the preset layer still precedes the skill bodies, so keeper-enabled skills remain
  the strongest STANDING directive, and the volatile tail's own instructional items
  (whispers, hook injections) still come last, so per-turn direction keeps recency;
- ``inject_document_context_prompt``'s knowledge pool sits at the END of the stable
  head, directly adjacent to the world lore it governs — the keeper-discipline and
  module-fidelity blocks it carries still read as framing for the lore below them.

Two nuances are worth knowing, and they are the same nuance twice: the rule for the
head is not "never changes", it is **does not change independently of an
invalidation that is already happening**.

- a room with NO initialized module pool falls back to vector search over raw
  uploads, and that text varies per turn, on nothing. Such a section is routed to
  the volatile tail instead, so the stable head stays honestly stable rather than
  nominally stable.
- the campaign summary DOES change — but only when a fold writes it, and a fold also
  moves ``campaign_summary.through_turn``, which makes ``agent.history.trim_folded``
  drop the front of the replayed history that very turn. The prefix was lost
  regardless; the summary merely rides an invalidation that has already happened,
  and is a cache read on every other turn. Open threads (``update_thread`` may fire
  any turn), the recalled records (re-retrieved every turn) and live state change
  ASYNCHRONOUSLY of any such event, so they stay in the tail: moving one of them up
  would blow the whole prefix at random.

``tests/agent/test_prompt_cache_layout.py`` is the oracle.

``i18n`` is rebound to ``ctx.locale`` so the whole prompt renders in the
caller's locale for this turn, independent of the process-wide default locale.

Whenever an initialized module knowledge pool exists,
``inject_document_context_prompt`` folds in the localized keeper-secrecy
discipline block (``prompt.keeper_discipline``) instructing the KP that
keeper-only material is for its own reasoning only and must never be quoted
to players; that instruction rides along automatically as part of this
assembly, it needs no special handling here.

KP skills (Layer B.1 — ``docs/plugins.md`` "Layer B") enabled for this room close
the stable head. This module reads the room's enabled-skill ids DIRECTLY off the
store (never importing ``gateway.ops`` — that would invert the layering; only
``core.skills`` is imported, which is below `agent`), tolerating a
missing/corrupt flag the same way ``gateway.ops.get_enabled_skills`` does. A
room with no skills enabled contributes nothing, so its prompt stays
byte-identical to a build with no skills layer at all.

Deterministic relationship tracks (``core.relationships`` — 好感/情欲, see iron
rule #1: the values are real code, only the narration around them is the model's
job) and module variables (``core.modvars`` — the same split: validated, clamped,
persisted values the model only narrates around) are live state and sit in the
volatile tail, read straight off the store the same inline way as the skills block
(never importing ``agent.kp_tools_relationships`` or ``gateway``). The Keeper sees
EVERY variable, with keeper-only ones carrying a localized never-reveal tag (iron
rule #3 — the transport-side filter in ``net.state`` is the structural guarantee;
this tag is the behavioral one). A room with neither contributes neither section,
not even an empty header.
