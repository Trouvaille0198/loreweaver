"""AI-played NPC records + their manager (`docs/specs/M5.md` §2).

`NpcRecord` is the persisted shape of one knowledge-scoped NPC sub-actor: its
own persona/voice, its own *discrete* `knowledge` (the complete epistemic
world `agent.npc_actor.voice_npc` is allowed to draw on — see that module's
docstring for the information-isolation contract this record exists to
support), and light session-state (`disposition`, `location`, `status`).

Persistence (M17): each NPC is one `npc` document (id = the slugified name,
insertion-ordered by the documents table's `seq` — no separate id-list row).
The `npc` document PROJECTION (`core.documents`) is the structural secrecy
contract: the keeper and the NPC's own actor view the full record; every
other viewer gets only the public subset. The async functions below are the
only read/write path; they hand back `NpcRecord`s built from document data.

No user-visible text originates here: every method either returns a
`NpcRecord`/`bool`/`None` or silently no-ops on a missing id, so there is
nothing for `agent.kp_tools_npc` to localize on this layer's behalf — all
framing text lives in the tools/actor layers that call this one.
