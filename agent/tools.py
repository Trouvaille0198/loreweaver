"""`@tool` decorator + `Toolset` — AI-KP function-calling schema generation and dispatch.

Marking an async provider method with `@tool` attaches an OpenAI
function-calling schema (built lazily from the method's type hints and
docstring) without altering its behavior. `Toolset` collects every
`@tool`-decorated method across one or more provider objects and dispatches
named tool calls to them, coercing JSON-ish arguments (e.g. the int-like
strings some models emit) to the method's declared parameter types.

Standalone by design: stdlib + typing only, plus `agent.context.AgentCtx`
(same layer) and `infra.i18n` for the two user/model-visible error strings
`dispatch()` can return (unknown tool name, bad/missing arguments) — it
never raises those into the calling loop.

    """Mark an async method as an AI-KP tool. Schema is generated from type hints + docstring.

    Usable bare (`@tool`) or parameterized (`@tool(keeper_only=True, params={...})`).
    `params` optionally maps `param_name -> human description`; `keeper_only`
    flags red-line tools that must never be quoted directly to players.
    `gated` (independent of `keeper_only` -- a tool can be either, both, or
    neither) flags an ADDITIVE toolset gate (Layer B.2 -- see
    ``docs/plugins.md`` "Layer B"): a gated tool is hidden from
    `Toolset.schemas()` and refused by `Toolset.dispatch()` unless its name is
    in the caller-supplied `unlocked` set (typically the union of enabled KP
    skills' `allowed-tools` for the room). The base toolset is never gated by
    default, so a tool with no `gated=True` behaves exactly as before.

    `prep_only` (M20 B) marks a BULK / LOW-FREQUENCY tool -- authoring a
    module-grade NPC, importing a lorebook, defining a variable, exporting a
    report -- which the room's `prep` phase carries and its `play` phase does
    not. The axis is bulk vs improvisational, NOT "prep-type work": improvising
    a shopkeeper mid-scene is ordinary play, which is why the light
    `sketch_npc` counterpart stays available in both. Unmarked means available
    in every phase, so a newly added tool is visible by default and the
    play-phase budget test is what notices it -- the reverse default would make
    a new tool silently unreachable in play.

    `read_only` (M20) declares that the tool WRITES NOTHING, which lets the loop
    dispatch a round of such calls concurrently. It cannot be inferred — a
    signature says nothing about whether a body mutates a document — and getting
    it wrong is a lost update, not a slow turn, so the default is False and only
    a genuine reader opts in. `speak_as_npc`/`companion_act` contain nested model
    calls and must never carry it.

    `needs` names a ROOM CAPABILITY the tool cannot work without — today the only
    one is `"module_pool"`, the knowledge pool a `--module` text upload builds. A
    world-card room (`.import … world`) never has one, so those five tools could only
    ever fail there: a 2026-08-18 play-test logged 102 such calls in 50 turns, ~2 per
    player turn of pure waste plus the model's attention. A tool whose `needs` is not
    in the caller's capability set is dropped from `schemas()` and refused by
    `dispatch()`, exactly like a gated or wrong-phase tool. Capabilities are recomputed
    every turn (`agent.tool_phase.room_capabilities`), so a room that gains a pool
    mid-session gets the tools back with no ceremony. Passing no capability set filters
    nothing — every caller that predates this is unaffected.

    Attaches the metadata to the function as `__tool_meta__`; the function's
    behavior is otherwise unchanged.
