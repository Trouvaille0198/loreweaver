"""The companion director -- pacing for AI party members (`docs/specs/M10-companions.md` §4).

An AI companion ACTS by feeding its declared action (from `agent.companion_actor.companion_action`)
through the *normal* turn pipeline (`gateway.turn.run_turn`) AS that companion -- with
`ctx.user_id = "companion:{id}"`, so the KP loop's `skill_check`/character tools operate on the
COMPANION's own sheet: a REAL roll on its REAL stats, adjudicated by the KP, fanned out to the hub.
The companion never rolls for itself.

Pacing (locked decisions):

- ``request_companion`` -- run ONE companion's turn now (exploration / on-request; `.party act`).
- ``run_combat_round`` -- iterate companions in initiative order ONCE, each taking a single turn,
  bounded by ``MAX_COMPANION_TURNS`` (anti-runaway) and honoring "pass" (an empty action → skip).
- ``run_director`` -- the AUTO-PACING entry point ``gateway.turn.run_turn`` calls after every real
  (non-command) AI-KP turn: runs one ``run_combat_round`` when ``.party auto`` is on AND the room is
  in combat (an active initiative order), else does nothing. Exploration stays on-request only.

Anti-runaway is structural: a companion turn NEVER spawns another. The director loop is the ONLY
place companion turns are scheduled, and it builds each companion turn a *hub-less* toolset (via
``build_kp_toolset(services)`` with no hub), so the ``companion_act`` KP tool can't re-enter the
director from inside a companion's own turn. ``run_director`` itself refuses to run at all when
called from within a companion's own turn (``ctx.platform == "companion"``), so even its ONE entry
point on the normal turn path (``gateway.turn.run_turn``) can never recurse.
