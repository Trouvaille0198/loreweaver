"""Platform-independent command router with EN slash and CN SealDice dialects.

A package since 2026-08-19: `router` holds the spec table and dispatch, and each command
domain is its own module composed into `CommandRouter` as a mixin (`checks`, `sheet`,
`rules`, `rooms`, `cast`, `world`, `panels`, `plot`, `media`, `llm`). Import the public names
from here; monkeypatch a helper where it is DEFINED (e.g. `gateway.commands.llm.flow_for`).
