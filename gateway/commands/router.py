"""The command router core: the spec table, alias resolution, dispatch, and `.help`.

Handlers live in per-domain mixins (`checks`, `sheet`, `rules`, `rooms`, `cast`, `world`,
`panels`, `media`, `llm`) that `CommandRouter` composes — the same shape `agent.kp_tools`
uses to compose tool providers. A new command lands in its domain module; this file
only learns its spec row."""

        The spec table is a SNAPSHOT of `all_command_words()` taken when the router was

        by `.pack install` in this room, or by ANOTHER process (the desktop client shells
        out to the CLI) — declared words that routed nowhere until a restart. Discovery
        already self-heals on a resolution miss; this is that doctrine one layer up.

        The throttle lives HERE rather than in `core.rulepacks` because the trigger is
        player-typed text — every unmatched `.word` is a miss — so an unthrottled probe
        would let one bad word start a stat storm; the interval is the discovery one, so a
        test that relaxes discovery relaxes this too. `force` is the IN-process door:
        `.pack install` knows a pack just landed and must not wait out an interval.

        Synchronous and swap-at-the-end: the tables are rebuilt into locals and assigned
        after, so a concurrent `resolve` on this shared router reads the old pair or the
        new one, never a half-built one.
