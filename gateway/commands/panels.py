    neither the return value nor that marker can tell a caller whether this call did
    anything — a room that already ran a module carries a truthy marker regardless. Hence
    `raise_on_failure`, and hence reading the room's rule system back afterwards rather
    than repeating the pin the pack asked for: the summary claims a pinned system only
    when the room is actually on it.
