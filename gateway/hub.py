"""RoomHub — the transport-agnostic session bus (M6 Phase 1).

The engine already scopes every piece of game state by ``chat_key`` (see
``net.state.build_room_state`` and the ``*.{chat_key}`` store keys), so any two
connections that resolve to the same ``session_key`` are, by construction,
playing the same session. What was missing is the *live* piece: a broadcast
bus that fans one turn's results out to every currently-connected member,
regardless of which transport each member speaks.

``RoomHub`` is that bus. It knows nothing about WebSockets, Discord cards or
SSH ptys — it only holds ``session_key -> {Member}`` and calls
``member.deliver(event)`` for each normalized :class:`Event`. Every concrete
transport supplies its own :class:`Member` whose ``deliver`` renders the event
into that transport's native frames (the terminal ``WsMember`` in
``net.tui_server`` is the first one). A member whose ``deliver`` raises is
dropped and logged; it never aborts the fan-out to the rest of the room.
