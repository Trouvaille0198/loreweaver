"""Shared, transport-agnostic turn runner (M6 Phase 1).

`run_turn` is the one place a player's input becomes a sequence of normalized
:class:`~gateway.hub.Event` objects published to the room. It used to live
inline in ``net.tui_server.dispatch_input``; hoisting it here means *every*
transport (the terminal WS today, chat adapters later) drives the exact same
turn machinery — ``gateway.commands.CommandRouter`` for slash/dot commands,
``agent.loop.run_kp_turn`` for the AI-KP — and every member of the room, on
whatever transport, receives the same fan-out via ``hub.publish``.

The published order follows the fiction's own: ``player_action`` echo -> each tool's
public consequences AS IT RUNS (a ``dice`` event per roll, a ``narrative`` with speaker
``npc`` per ``speak_as_npc``) -> the ``narrative`` (speaker ``kp``) reply -> one ``ui``
event per hook-emitted UI frame (protocol v1.7) -> the room ``state`` snapshot. Those
tool events were once read off the FINISHED trace, which put them after the reply's
streaming draft had already opened — so a streaming turn showed the narration above the
roll it narrated and a non-streaming turn showed it below, same room, order decided by
the provider. They are also recorded as they happen (``record_turn_events``, anchored to
the transcript line they followed) so a member who joins or reconnects replays the same
scene — the same interleaving — rather than one with every roll missing. On a real
(non-command) AI-KP turn, the KP narrative is also followed by a best-effort
call into ``gateway.director.run_director`` (M10), which lets the party's AI
companions take an auto-paced turn (their own sub-turns fan out through this
same function) before the room ``state`` snapshot is published.

    """Run one player turn and publish its normalized events to the room.

    Fans events out to *every* member of ``ctx.chat_key``'s room via
    ``hub.publish`` (not just ``origin``), so a player on any transport sees
    the same turn. Returns the :class:`~agent.loop.KPTurnResult` for an AI-KP
    turn (so the caller can record it for observability) or ``None`` for a
    command turn.

    ``echo_exclude`` is applied ONLY to the ``player_action`` echo: the WS server
    passes ``None`` (a solo terminal still sees its own echo — the M4 behavior),
    while the chat runner passes ``origin`` so the origin channel — which already
    shows the player's own message — does not re-echo it, though OTHER transports
    still render who acted. Everything after the echo (dice/npc/kp/state) always
    goes to ALL members, including ``origin``.

    ``actor_name`` overrides the echoed/attributed actor name (member name, else
    ``ctx.uid()``). An AI companion turn (``gateway.director.run_companion_turn``)
    runs with no ``origin`` member but passes the companion's display name here so
    the room sees ``Silas: I cover the door`` rather than the raw ``companion:silas``.

    ``model_authored=True`` marks a turn whose ``text`` is LLM-generated (a companion /
    director action), NOT human input. It bypasses the command router and the inline-roll
    fallback ENTIRELY -- model output must never reach a parser built for human input (it
    would let a generated ".party act X" recurse into the director, a ".bot off" flip room
    state with EVERYONE privilege, or an inline "[[1d6]]" silently swallow the KP turn) --
    and instead feeds ``text`` straight into the KP pipeline as pure narration/action, still
    publishing a ``player_action`` so the room can attribute the effect. Companion dice go
    ONLY through the KP toolset (``skill_check`` etc.), never via text pattern matching.

    A command turn whose matched ``gateway.commands.CommandSpec.private_reply`` is set
    (e.g. ``.model key``/``.lore query``, which can echo a masked API key or keeper-only
    secret lore) delivers its reply ONLY to ``origin`` via ``Member.deliver`` — never
    ``hub.publish`` — so the rest of the room never sees it. With no ``origin`` (a
    transport with no per-connection member) this falls back to the normal broadcast.

    On a real (non-command) AI-KP turn, once the KP's own narrative is published,
    this also best-effort records the turn's token/cache usage
    -- surfaced by ``net.state.build_room_state`` as ``state.usage`` -- and gives the
    party's AI companions (M10) a chance to auto-act via
    ``gateway.director.run_director`` — a no-op outside combat / with `.party auto`
    off, and, critically, ALWAYS a no-op when ``ctx.platform == "companion"`` (a
    companion's own turn re-enters this function and must never re-trigger the
    director — the structural anti-runaway `gateway.director` describes). A
    companion-pacing failure is logged and swallowed, never allowed to turn a
    successful player turn into a surfaced error. The post-turn Scribe pass
    carries the same ``ctx.platform != "companion"`` guard for the same reason:
    one PLAYER turn buys exactly one reconciliation pass, however large the party.

    inline — a one-shot ``--exec`` process has no later moment to hide the latency in,
    and a task killed by process exit would silently lose the bookkeeping. That
    hubless channel was exactly how the CLI ran 12+ turns with zero chronicle records
    (k3 pipeline playtest, D2): the pass was never scheduled there at all.

    With ``hub=None`` the pass keeps everything durable (chronicle records, tracker
    reconciliation, whispers, habits) and skips only what speaks in wire frames: the
    state republish and the Stage Director, which stages `ui`/`audio` frames a
    hubless channel has nowhere to deliver (documented in docs/operating.md).

    Gated on ``ctx.platform != "companion"`` for the structural reason
    `gateway.director` describes: a companion's own turn re-enters the turn flow, and
    without the gate one player turn with N companions spent 1+N Scribe calls and
    drained the whisper channel into its own sub-turns. The PLAYER turn's pass
    already sees the whole exchange.

    Gated on ``result.turn`` for a second one: a turn that committed nothing has no
    boundary to bookkeep. ``run_kp_turn`` still RETURNS on a provider error — a
    localized diagnosis carrying ``turn == 0`` — but it persists no history and never
    advances the chronicle counter. Running the pass anyway pointed
    `refresh_latest_snapshot` at the UNMOVED counter, so the previous turn's undo
    snapshot was re-photographed with the dead attempt's `turn_start` hook writes, the
    tool calls that landed before the provider died, and the pass's own whisper welded
    into it — and ``.undo`` to that turn could no longer take them out. The
    auto-chronicle lane (`agent.scribe._record_auto_chronicle`) already refuses
    ``turn <= 0`` for the same reason; this is that line drawn one level up, where it
    also covers the model call and the snapshot. It lives HERE, not at the two call
    sites, so the hub path and the inline CLI path (`gateway.runner`) cannot drift —

    no place in a lane that is re-broadcast to whoever joins next.

    The anchor is a message ID, not a turn number: replay walks the persisted transcript
    and emits each anchored event right after its message, so a KP roll made before a
    companion spoke lands before the companion's line and one made after lands after it;
    a typed roll (`.ra`, `r 3d6`) anchors to the last reply; anything before the first
    turn anchors to the root (""). Turn numbers cannot carry that — a companion sub-turn
    advances the counter mid-turn, so two messages can share a stamp and a stamp can
    have no message. The turn IS kept on the record, for the lane's window.
