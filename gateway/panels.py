"""Room-level module UI panels (M15): manifests, enable/disable plumbing, asset lookup.

`core.panels` owns the schema; this module owns the ROOM view of it. Enabled pack ids
live at ``room_panels.{chat_key}`` (`gateway.ops`); each enabled pack resolves to its
installed home (``data_dir/packs/<id>@<version>/`` — see `core.pack.install_pack`),
whose built ``pack.yaml`` + declared panels files are re-parsed on demand. A pack that
fails to load degrades to "no panels from this pack (logged)", never to a broken room.

Iron-rule threading happens here, in exactly two functions:

- :func:`build_ui_manifest_frame` resolves ``audience`` per viewer ROLE before anything
  reaches the wire (`core.panels.audience_allows`) — a keeper-only panel structurally
  never enters a player's manifest, and ``audience`` itself never rides the frame.
- :func:`resolve_pack_asset` answers hash→bytes lookups ONLY from packs enabled in the
  caller's room (no arbitrary blob oracle), verifying the bytes still match their
  manifest digest before serving.

Everything is read-on-demand: rooms rarely flip panels, panels files are ≤ 256 KB, and
re-reading keeps enable/install/upgrade coherent without a cache to invalidate.
