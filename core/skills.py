"""KP-skill discovery and parsing (Layer B.1 — see ``docs/plugins.md`` "Layer B").

A "skill" packages a play style (tone, focus, a content gate, ...) as a
Claude-Code-style ``skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md`` bundle: YAML frontmatter
followed by a Markdown body. Dropping a new ``skills/<id>/SKILL.md`` file
makes it discoverable — no code change, mirroring ``core.rulepacks``'s
discovery style.

This module is a pure DATA layer, parallel to ``core.rulepacks``: discovery
and parsing only, no ``store``/``infra`` imports. Per-room enablement lives in
``gateway.ops`` (``get_enabled_skills``/``set_enabled_skills``); folding an
enabled skill's body into the KP system prompt is ``agent.prompt_builder``'s
job; the content-rating censor gate is ``gateway.ops.room_content_unfiltered``
+ ``gateway.turn``. Nothing here is ever ``eval``/``exec``-ed: the frontmatter
is parsed with ``yaml.safe_load`` (via ``core.yaml_safety.safe_load_no_aliases``, which additionally
rejects alias/anchor nodes -- see that module) only, and the Markdown body is opaque text.

``unlocked_tools_for`` (Layer B.2 -- ``allowed-tools`` enforcement, see
``docs/plugins.md`` "Layer B") is the one exception to "no store imports": it
takes a duck-typed `store` parameter (shaped like ``infra.store.Store`` --
an async ``state_get(room, key)``) rather than importing ``infra.store``, so
this module still imports nothing from ``infra``/``agent``/``gateway`` and
stays below both in the layering; callers in either layer can use it directly.
