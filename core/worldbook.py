"""Worldbook lore entries and retrieval.

This module is intentionally self-contained for the M11 leaf pass: it owns the
entry model, persistence/indexing, keyword/vector matching, import
normalization, and the prompt section renderer.

Conditional injection (the EJS-compat pass): an entry may carry a `condition` —
a safe `core.condexpr` expression over the room's deterministic variables
(`core.varspace` unifies modvars + the imported MVU tree). At match time a
conditioned entry only fires when its expression is true; FAIL-CLOSED both ways
(a broken condition, or no resolver supplied, means "don't inject"). At
injection time entry content is rendered through `core.ejs_lite` (the EJS
subset + `{{getvar::}}`/`{{var:}}` macros) with NO setter — prompt assembly is
read-only and idempotent by design, so template `setvar(...)` statements are
deliberate no-ops there. SillyTavern imports map `@@if` decorators onto
`condition`, consume `[InitVar]`/`@@initial_variables` entries into the MVU
variable tree instead of storing them as lore, and disable render-time-only
entries (`[RENDER:*]` / `@@render_*` / `@@iframe` — frontend status-bar UI that
must never reach a prompt).

        fires only when its condition evaluates true, and FAILS CLOSED (broken expression, or no
