"""`.lwpack` community packs — deterministic build, inspection and install (no network).

A pack is one self-contained zip with a root ``pack.yaml`` manifest bundling a work's
skills (SKILL.md + optional hooks.js), rulepacks, SillyTavern cards, lorebooks and media
assets. Distribution is Git: a pack rides a repo release; there is deliberately NO central
registry (``infra.pack_source`` resolves ``gh:owner/repo[@tag]`` refs to a release asset).

Trust stance mirrors full-EJS/hooks (docs/plugins.md): installing is the operator's
decision about the operator's box, so the CLI shows a generated ``trust`` summary
(counts, hooks presence, asset bytes) instead of gating. What IS a red line is byte
integrity and filesystem confinement — this module is the one place untrusted archive
bytes reach the disk, so every entry name is validated against traversal (zip-slip),
symlink entries are rejected, per-asset sha256 digests are verified against the
manifest before anything lands, and sizes/counts are capped throughout.

Install means "on disk and discoverable", never "enabled for a room": skills land in the
user skill dir and rulepacks in the user rulepack dir (existing discovery; built-ins are
never overridden), while cards/lorebooks/assets land under ``data_dir/packs/<id>@<version>/``
for the existing in-room import flows to consume.

Builds are byte-deterministic (sorted entry order, fixed zip timestamps, stable manifest
dump), so packing the same source twice yields the identical file — and the same sha256.
