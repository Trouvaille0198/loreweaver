"""Card splitting ("拆卡") — the character half vs the world machinery, deterministically.

A SillyTavern "heavy card" is a WORLD wearing a character card's clothing: hook scripts,
variable schemas (``[InitVar]``), and executable EJS ride along with the persona because
upstream's single-player architecture had nowhere else to put them. Loreweaver has real
module/keeper concepts, so import splits every card into its two native artifacts instead
of carrying the fusion forward:

- the CHARACTER half — persona prose, sheet-relevant fields, plain personal lore — safe
  for any player to self-import;
- the WORLD payloads — hook scripts, variable declarations, executable templates — which
  only the room's keeper may bring in (``.import <file> world``), because they reshape
  play for everyone at the table.

Detection and stripping are pure functions with no model involvement (iron rule #1), so
the player-path guarantee is structural: a stripped card CANNOT install room hooks, seed
the shared variable tree, or execute template code, regardless of how it is phrased.
`agent.kp_tools_charcard` runs every import through here; `core.worldbook` reuses
:func:`is_variable_declaration_entry` so the two layers can never disagree about what
counts as variable machinery.
