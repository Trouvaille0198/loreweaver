"""Character sheet management, generic over pack-declared sheet shapes.

M16 stage B: this module holds NO system rules. A sheet's fresh-slot tables,
canonical-name bridges, derived slots, vitals and creation rolls all come from
the sheet's rulepack (``sheet:`` / ``creation_constraints:`` — see
`core.sheets`); this module is the storage + lifecycle layer (documents CRUD,
party roster, active-character pointers) plus the pack-driven `CharacterSheet`
container. ``system`` on a sheet is any name `core.rulepacks.load_rulepack`
resolves; a sheet whose system resolves to no pack degrades to bare storage
dicts with no derivations.
